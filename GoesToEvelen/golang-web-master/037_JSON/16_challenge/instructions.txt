IN AN HTML FILE
- create an array to hold objects in javascript. Each object should store a "Code" as in an number and "Descrip" as a string. The array should hold all of the objects. Create objects for the following HTTP status codes:

    StatusOK                   = 200

    StatusMovedPermanently  = 301
    StatusFound             = 302
    StatusSeeOther          = 303
    StatusTemporaryRedirect = 307

    StatusBadRequest                   = 400
    StatusUnauthorized                 = 401
    StatusPaymentRequired              = 402
    StatusForbidden                    = 403
    StatusNotFound                     = 404
    StatusMethodNotAllowed             = 405
    StatusTeapot                       = 418

    StatusInternalServerError           = 500

- stringify that data to JSON

- display that JSON in the browser window

IN A GO FILE
- Create a variable with the identifier "rcvd" of type string. Store a raw string literal of the JSON created in the previous step as the value of the variable "rcvd".

- Unmarshal "rcvd" into a data structure with the identifier "data"

- use a for range loop to iterate through "data" displaying the results to stdout
